To install, navigate to your home profile ${HOME}/.config/inkscape/icons and place the svg file there, leave it named
as is (icons.svg). If some of the icons are replaced by your system settings, it's a bit trickier there. There is a
system folder somewhere, usually in your USR/SHARE folders, that has a system backup of your default icons for inkscape.
This varries by distrabution, but I'll share the ones I know of in a seperate file. At any rate, once you find
that icon folder, you delete it, and the icons will no longer be inherited by inkscape and it will show the designated
icons in the svg.Every time you update something related to that folder however, it will replace the icons again... So,
just be aware you might have to delete it on a few ocasions.

Also be aware, a few of the icons are not mapped for various reasons. Consider this a beta-release, like open-beta. I 
am still working on a few minor polish items. If you find a major icon, that is not mapped that you feel should be,
let me know, I could have over-looked it, or the mapping might have given an error I missed, etc and I'll update it.
But, last I checked, it was only maybe 3-4 icons that were not mapped, or not intended to be mapped at this time, it 
should be 98% functional.
