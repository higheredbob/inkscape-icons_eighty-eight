Inkscape icons- Theme eighty-eight

![Image of Eighty-eight](https://github.com/higheredbob/inkscape-icons_eighty-eight/blob/master/icons.svg%20-%20Inkscape_005.png)

Material and Font Awesome based, mostly stuck with material as I was aiming to update 
the base theme to as new as possible. 
But, some material icon's just don't look that good to me, so I subbed in font-awesome where I felt it looked better.
I ended up redesigning several times, portions of the svg board. 
I will make those icons available as well, just in case you end up liking them more than the ones
I chose. Since if you look in my screen shots' you'll notice one of the backgrounds I use, is a deep sea blue, I 
formatted the icons to show on my display. I also use some dark grey ones, but I don't use any light or purely black
themes, so, some of the other icons I couldn't make out as well might just suit your theme. So, if you know how to
assign (or map) the icons, feel free to do so, if you like the additional icons, I didn't settle on. 

The alternate icons are great Icons, and I feel they look good, just something didn't 
jive right with my theme. At any rate, it's at least another 50 icons in total to use with inkscape, 
which I haven't been able to find a ton icon options for. And the stock icons are terrible in my opinion.

If you are going to use the icons for any purpose, just give me a heads up. I would appreciate credit when appropriate.

I'm still not done with this set however, consider it a beta release. I just felt it good enough to open up to 
everyone, while I make the few tweaks to a few rows I'm still not thrilled with. Expect those updates to happen
quickly, as with the other icons I replaced, I will make them available in an svg plate.

I do have a flat theme planned, and already in the works, but only a few icons so far made for it. Expect that one, 
in roughly a month. Hope you enjoy!
